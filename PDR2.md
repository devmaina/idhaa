Certainly! Let's delve into some code snippets to illustrate key components of the Intelligent Traffic Analytics and Management System.

1. Data Collection:

python
Copy code
# Sample code for collecting real-time data from traffic cameras and sensors
import traffic_sensor_api

def collect_traffic_data():
    # API call to traffic sensor system
    data = traffic_sensor_api.get_real_time_data()
    return data
2. AI Models:

python
Copy code
# Using machine learning models for traffic prediction
import tensorflow as tf

def train_traffic_prediction_model(training_data):
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        # Define layers for traffic prediction model
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(num_features,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
    ])

    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
    model.fit(training_data, epochs=10)
    return model
3. Analytics:

python
Copy code
# Generating congestion index reports and traffic analytics
import pandas as pd

def generate_congestion_report(data):
    # Analyze traffic data and generate congestion index report
    congestion_index = analyze_data(data)
    return congestion_index

def analyze_data(data):
    # Sample analysis function
    # ... (perform analytics on the data)
    return congestion_index
4. Real-Time Updates:

python
Copy code
# Implementing dynamic system for real-time updates
import dynamic_route_optimizer

def update_routes_based_on_predictions(predictions):
    # Use AI predictions to dynamically update routes
    new_routes = dynamic_route_optimizer.optimize_routes(predictions)
    return new_routes
5. City Planning:

python
Copy code
# Suggesting locations for new road construction using mapping tools
import mapping_api

def suggest_new_road_locations(traffic_data):
    # Analyze traffic data and suggest optimal road locations
    suggested_locations = mapping_api.find_optimal_locations(traffic_data)
    return suggested_locations
6. Fleet Management:

python
Copy code
# Enabling tracking of buses and vehicles for fleet management
import fleet_management_api

def track_vehicles(vehicles):
    # Use fleet management API to track vehicles
    current_locations = fleet_management_api.get_vehicle_locations(vehicles)
    return current_locations
These code snippets provide a glimpse into the functionalities of the Intelligent Traffic Analytics 
and Management System. The actual implementation would require integration with specific APIs,
databases, and additional logic tailored to the unique requirements of the system.
